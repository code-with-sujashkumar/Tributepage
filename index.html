                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on December 22, 1887, in Erode, 
                    a small town in the Madras Presidency of British India (now Tamil Nadu, India). 
                    He hailed from a modest Tamil Brahmin family. 
                    Ramanujan's mathematical talent was evident from a young age, and he developed a deep interest in numbers and equations. 
                    However, his formal education was disrupted due to financial constraints, and he largely pursued mathematics independently.
                </p>

            <div id="career">
                <h1>Career</h1>
                <p>
                    Ramanujan's mathematical journey began with self-study and the exploration of various mathematical texts. 
                    In 1911, he began writing letters to renowned mathematicians, seeking recognition and support for his work. 
                    One such letter reached G.H. Hardy, a prominent British mathematician at the University of Cambridge. 
                    Impressed by Ramanujan's extraordinary talent, Hardy invited him to Cambridge in 1914.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During his time in Cambridge, Ramanujan made significant contributions to several branches of mathematics, including number theory, analysis, and infinite series. 
                    His work was highly unconventional and often lacked formal proofs, which initially faced skepticism. 
                    Nevertheless, Ramanujan's remarkable intuition and ability to perceive patterns led to the discovery of numerous groundbreaking results.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="success">
                <h1>Major Successes</h1>
                <p>
                    Ramanujan's most celebrated achievement is his work on the theory of partitions, where he devised a groundbreaking formula for calculating the number of integer partitions. 
                    He also made significant contributions to the field of modular forms and discovered many profound identities related to theta functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His collaboration with G.H. Hardy resulted in several notable contributions, including the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotic formula, which provides an approximation for the number of prime partitions. 
                    Ramanujan's work on continued fractions, elliptic functions, and mock theta functions also garnered significant attention and played a crucial role in advancing the field of mathematics.

            <div id="achievements">
                <h1>Achievements and Awards</h1>
                <p>Despite his relatively short life, Ramanujan left an indelible mark on the field of mathematics. His contributions earned him widespread recognition and numerous accolades. Some of his notable achievements and awards include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Elected Fellow of the Royal Society (1918): Ramanujan became the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, a prestigious scientific academy based in London.</li>
                    <li>Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge (1918): Ramanujan was awarded a fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, which provided financial support and recognition for his work.</li>
                    <li>Ramanujan Medal ( awarded posthumously): In recognition of his exceptional contributions to mathematics, the Indian National Science Academy established the Ramanujan Medal in his honor, awarded every two years to mathematicians under the age of 32.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="lifestyle">
                <h1>Personal Life & Legacy</h1>
                <p>
                    Ramanujan's personal life was marked by struggles and health issues. His time in England was challenging, with cultural and dietary differences affecting his well-being. Moreover, he suffered from poor health, exacerbated by his neglect of personal care due to his intense focus on mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sadly, Ramanujan's life was cut short, and he passed away at the age of 32 on April 26, 1920, in Chennai, India. His legacy, however, continues to inspire generations of mathematicians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ramanujan's notebooks, containing his unpublished work and mathematical discoveries, were the subject of intense study after his death. They have provided mathematicians with new insights and avenues for exploration. Today, Ramanujan is recognized as one of the most extraordinary mathematicians in history, known for his profound contributions and remarkable intuition.
